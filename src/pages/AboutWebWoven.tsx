                Web Woven was founded in 2020 with a simple yet powerful vision: to make web development more accessible for businesses of all sizes. It all began when our founder, Sharad Raj Aryal, wanted to create a website for himself. He quickly realized that the available options were either too expensive—ranging into thousands of pounds—or too basic to meet professional needs. This experience inspired the creation of Web Woven, a company dedicated to bridging the gap between affordability and quality in web design.

                We understand that for many small and medium-sized businesses, spending £2,500 to £6,000 on a website might seem like a significant investment. As a result, some business owners turn to drag-and-drop website builders. While these tools are cost-effective, they often lead to websites that fall short in terms of functionality, design, and user experience. At Web Woven, we believe every business deserves a professional website that not only looks great but also works seamlessly to drive growth.
